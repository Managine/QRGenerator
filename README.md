#QRGenerator
This is a automatic QRCode generator used to generate a QR code containing a given string with a pattern like an input picture. <br>
All the process could be controled by a few parameters.<br>
It's very amazing and attractive, if you wish to have a try.

##How to use
Run "QRGenerator.py" in the directory "ui". <br>
Please refer to the "User Guide.pdf" in the root directory.

##How to edit
The directory "controlSize" is used to generate a .dll file for the main function in C language.<br>
Please copy the "QRGenerator.dll" from "\controlSize\Debug" to "ui" after editing and re-generating. <br>
And the directory "ui" is the main window written in tkinter.<br>
